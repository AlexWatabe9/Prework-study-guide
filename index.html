          <li>What is HTML? HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li> HTML is used to create the structure of a website</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>

          <li>CSS- Cascading Style sheet</li>
          <li>Allows you to add style to your website</li>
          <li>CSS is a programing language that is uded by developers to define how webpage content is presented to the user</li>
          <li>Inline CSS - When a developer wants to style an element directly in HTML file</li>
          <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag using a style attributed with a CSS rule</li></li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet- embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file uses style element</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Java script adds interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>javascript(JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>you can power your websites with effectsm interactivity, data comminication, and more </li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. 
            All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. To learn more about truthy and falsy values,</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. In order to use the for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length.</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0)</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the 
            length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, 
              x will increase by 1</li>
          <li>Functionsa set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
